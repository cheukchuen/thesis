\todo[inline]{How about as a title: Adding Support for Use Case Maps to CORE}

\todo[inline]{Then talk about (or remind the reader about) motivation, then detail that there needs to be support in the metamodel, the concrete syntax, and the weaving algorithm. It could also be possible to not talk about the concrete syntax here, but in the next chapter (the implementation). This chapter really describes the conceptual work of adding UCMS to CORE.}

\section{UCM Metamodel}

\subsection{Abstract Syntax}

\subsection{Concrete Syntax}

\todo[inline]{Maybe move this to the next chapter... To discuss}

\section{Weaver}

\todo[inline]{Again, maybe we need a short intro here. I assume there is also a common algorithm to extensions and reuses, or are they completely separate?}

\subsection{Model Reuse}
