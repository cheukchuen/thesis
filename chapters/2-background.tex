First paragraph opens with URN and its components.

\todo[inline]{I would start this chapter by a short paragraph that presents the outline of the chapter, i.e., that you will talk about use case maps, then CORE, then tools. Since this is the background chapter, I would also recommend to not put the motivation here... either move it to the introduction, or else at the beginning of chapter 3.}
