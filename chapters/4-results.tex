The definition of UCM metamodel and the specification of weaving algorithm described in previous chapter provide the foundation for the implementation of UCM in TouchCORE. In this chapter, we illustrate the realization of scenario models in TouchCORE through the use of UCM notation in section \ref{sec:4.1}. Then we describe the weaving process for extensions and reuses in section \ref{sec:4.2}.
