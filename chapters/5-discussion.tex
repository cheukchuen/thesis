UCM allows us to describe precise sequences  graphically display a workflow model. In this chapter, we attempt to validate our proposed approach of concern-oriented UCMs by means of case studies in section \ref{sec:5.1}. Then we demonstrate that concern-oriented UCMs are able to cover the workflow patterns in section \ref{sec:5.2}.

\todo[inline]{Like I said, maybe you could add a section here on the implementation, in case you remove the previous chapter.}
