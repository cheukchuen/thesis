URN consists of two notations: GRL for modeling non-functional requirements, and UCM for modeling functional requirements. In this chapter, we describe UCM as part of the requirements engineering tool and its use in specifying scenarios in section \ref{sec:2.1}. Then we detail about CORE as a reuse technique with the current state of development in section \ref{sec:2.2}. Finally, we provide an overview of related work to modeling tools, applicable to the use of UCM and concern-orientation, in section \ref{sec:2.3}.

\section{Use Case Map (UCM)} \label{sec:2.1}

This section describes UCM in detail.

\section{Concern-oriented Reuse (CORE)} \label{sec:2.2}

This section describes CORE in detail.

\subsection{Reusable Aspect Models (RAM)}

\section{Review of Related Modeling Tools} \label{sec:2.3}

Literature review.

Last paragraph leads to implementation chapter.
